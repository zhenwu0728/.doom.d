#+title: Getting Started Guide
* Install Emacs
** On macOS
*** With Homebrew
First, install Doom's dependencies.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# required dependencies
brew install git ripgrep
# optional dependencies
brew install coreutils fd
# Installs clang
xcode-select --install
#+END_SRC

Then install Emacs itself. I recommend [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][emacs-plus]]
#+begin_src bash
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus
ln -s /usr/local/opt/emacs-plus/Emacs.app /Applications/Emacs.app
#+end_src

* Install Doom Emacs
First, clone Doom Emacs to =~/.emacs.d/=:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs ~/.emacs.d
#+END_SRC

#+begin_quote
I recommend you add =~/.emacs.d/bin= to your ~PATH~ so you can call =doom= directly and from anywhere. Accomplish this by adding this to your .bashrc or .zshrc file: ~export PATH="$HOME/.emacs.d/bin:$PATH"~
#+end_quote

Then clone =.doom.d= to =~/.doom.d/=
#+begin_src bash
git clone https://github.com/zhenwu0728/.doom.d.git ~/.doom.d/
#+end_src

Finally, initiate Doom Emacs.
#+begin_src bash
# If you know Emacs won't be launched from your shell environment (e.g. you're on macOS or use an app launcher that doesn't launch programs with the correct shell) then create an envvar file to ensure Doom correctly inherits your shell environment.
doom env

# Then synchronize Doom with your config:
doom sync
doom update
#+end_src
